A Glimpse into the drawer containing a user’s files, a dark mode option has been added and you can see from the file created in the previous screenshot that it is being linked by the default file.

CURRENT STATE AND WHERE ID LIKE TO GO
Currently all of the technical requirements for the project are completed in some way, shape, or form. There are containers, columns, rows; elevated buttons, drop down buttons, toggle buttons; dark mode and light mode; navigation; data storage via SharedPreferences; multiple in-text commands to make it not just a standard notes app; and an input validation check when no commands are stated. My personal favorite addition is the linked to and linked by sections, making navigation between similar files much easier. Despite every technical requirement being met, I still do not feel like the app is fully finished to my liking. 

If I am able to give my application more time and effort I’d love to add in a lot more text commands, specifically fonts and a color tween option. I would’ve also loved to build more on my drop-down button, that way you can add in a dnd character sheet option and a realistic weather option where you can input the date, and it shows the weather for said date. I also want to add tabs for navigation so every time you open a new text file it shows at the top, and you can go in between your already opened files.
